1. Wavetable Synthesis
	Repeating a number of samples over and over, producing a purely periodic signal.

Y:		Value of the t_th sample -> x(n)
Y_t=Y_t-p	Wavetable Algorithm
p:		wavetable length / periodicity parameter
	Amount of memory / period of the tone (samples)

Initial Conditions completely determine the timbre.

Sine/square/triangle/other simple wave is calculated and loaded with sample frequency f_s. Frequency of the tone is f_s/p.

The wavetable can be seen as a delay line of length p.

	a. How to Generate the Wavetable:
	

2. Plucked String Algorithm

Y_t = 0.5*(Y_t-p + Y_t-p-1)

Resulting tone: p + 1/2 => f = fs/(p+ 1/2)

Y_t = +- A con probabilidad 0,5. -p =< t =< 0
